# Netflix Clone

## Introduction

Cloned netflix without adding all its features. My main goals were learning webpack, styled components and eslint configuration. I used [MovieDB API for movie data](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). Trailers on the pages were sent as a youtube url from MovieDB api so I had to use iframe in that part. I feel good at responsive design but in this project I did not develop the project as responsive because of my limited time and main goal was not responsive.

## Tools

React, Express, Webpack, Styled Components, Splide.js, axios

## Deployment Link

## Setup

Clone project to your computer `git clone https://github.com/baristunar/netflix-clone.git`

You should put your personel moviedb api key to .env file. You can get it from [themoviedb's website](https://developers.themoviedb.org/) `API_KEY=<YOUR MOVIEDB APIKEY>`

Starting local server `yarn dev`

Build `yarn start` then `yarn build`
